# About
Test application for job opportunity at Agence
I recently applied for a position as a Junior Mobile Developer at Agence. I went through the selection process that contained two stages, the first was logical reasoning and the second was a test focused on the world of flutter development.

My results in the first stage were satisfactory, which conditioned me to perform the last stage before the interview. It was really good, it was intense.

I was supposed to develop it in 15 hours, but it was much more than that, a challenge for me as a beginner.

As I write this excerpt from the README, I have just sent my application to recruiters. It's not complete, I did something simple, which for someone who is already a professional in the area would take much less time. I am very proud of this project, it was very challenging.
